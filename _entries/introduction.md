Welcome to JSONAPI Suite! This gem is a collection of libraries to
enabled quick and easy [jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org)-compatible APIs
with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).

If you only have 5 seconds to look at this, we recommend you take a
glance at [The Basics](#basics).

There is also a [sample Rails/Ember application](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/jsonapi_suite_sample_app) to see real-world usage.
