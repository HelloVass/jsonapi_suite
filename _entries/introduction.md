Welcome to JSONAPI Suite! This gem is a collection of libraries to
enabled quick and easy [jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org)-compatible APIs
with Ruby. [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) is recommended, but not
required.

If you only have 5 seconds to look at this, we recommend you take a
glance at the [Quickstart](#quickstart).

If you prefer following a tutorial with a [sample application](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory), including [client-side
usage](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory), please go [here](https://gist.github.com/richmolj/c7f1adca75f614bb71b27f259ff3c37a).
